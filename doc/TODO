  Paradise is exactly like where you are 
  right now... only much, much better.

  - Check TCP and IP checksums, would you?

  - Allow listening on multiple interfaces.

  - Solve tmp/ mysteries,

  - Some more SYN+ACK and RST+ signatures,

  - Add timestamp multipliers.
  
  - Add "skip dupes" option (cache is already there); until then,
    pipe p0f through uniq if you must.

  - Towards cummulative fingerprinting: SYN, SYN+ACK, RST+, FIN+,
    retransmit timing.
