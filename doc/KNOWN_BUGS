Known unresolved issues with p0f v2:
------------------------------------

  - Uptime is reported incorrectly for some systems that use
    more unusual timestamp frequencies. This will be addressed in the
    next release.

  - The SYN|ACK database is not maintained at the moment.

  - -Q can lag on certain systems and libpcap versions due to
    no timeout handling.
